# EDteam Copy

Hello and nice to meet you, the project you're currently visiting/seeing is a full design copy based on the EDteam website (https://ed.team/), focused on delivering courses to its users. This project was designed to work on both 1440px desktop screens and the iPhone 14 Pro Max (432px width).

We used the best technologies we know, like Bootstrap, CSS, HTML, and Sass, to automate variables, repeated colors, backgrounds, and other styles used multiple times.

I invite you to check out one of my best projects so far as a junior developer and CSS designer. Thanks for reading, I hope we can meet or even work together in the future. Bye, and good luck!
